# Project name: Agent-GTD
MVP scope: Create Goal → Break into Tasks → Simple Reminder
 * User stories (the ones we selected):
   1. As a user, I want to create a new Goal so that I can track my big-picture objectives.
   2. As a user, I want to break a Goal into actionable Tasks so I know exactly what to work on today.
   3. As a user, I want to receive a reminder at a set time so I don’t forget my daily Tasks.
 * Tech stack (we’ll start with Encore + Postgres for backend, React Native Expo for frontend, and later hook in the Agentic AI layer).
